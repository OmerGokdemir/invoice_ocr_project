# Invoice OCR Extraction

This Python project extracts key information from scanned PDF invoices using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with **Tesseract** and image conversion tools.
It reads PDF files from an input folder, extracts invoice details such as Invoice Number, Date, Total Amount, and Company Name, and saves the results into both CSV and Excel files.

## üöÄ Features

*   Convert PDF pages to images for OCR processing

*   Extract invoice data (Invoice Number, Date, Total Amount, Company Name) using regex

*   Save extracted data to CSV and XLSX formats

*   Works with scanned PDFs (image-based) using Tesseract OCR

*   Easy to configure input/output directories and filenames

****

## üì¶ Requirements

* Python 3.x

* [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) installed and added to your system PATH (or specify executable path in script)

* Python libraries:

  *   pytesseract

  *   pdf2image

  *   pandas

  *   Pillow

  *   openpyxl (for Excel export)

Install Python dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install pytesseract pdf2image pandas pillow openpyxl
```

****

## üñ•Ô∏è Setup

1. Install Tesseract OCR:
   *   Download and install from the official repository.
   *   Make sure to update the `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd` variable in the script with the correct path to your Tesseract executable if it's not in your system PATH.

2. Input PDFs:
   *   Place your scanned invoice PDF files into the `invoices` directory (create if it doesn't exist).

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python extract_invoices.py
    ```

****

## Output

*   `extracted_invoices.csv` ‚Äî CSV file with extracted invoice data

*   `extracted_invoices.xlsx` ‚Äî Excel file with the same data for easier analysis


## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

*   Converts each page of the PDF into an image

*   Performs OCR on the images to extract text

*   Uses regular expressions to find invoice details in the text

*   Aggregates data from all PDFs into structured tabular format

## üë§ Customization

*   Modify `INPUT_DIR`, `OUTPUT_CSV`, `OUTPUT_XLSX` in the script to change input/output paths

*   Update regex patterns in `extract_data_from_text()` for different invoice formats or to extract additional fields

## üß™ Troubleshooting

*   **No data extracted?**
    Check Tesseract OCR installation and paths

*   **Wrong or incomplete data?**
    Adjust regex expressions to match your invoice layouts

*   **Performance issues?**
    Processing scanned PDFs can be slow; consider batching files or optimizing OCR parameters
